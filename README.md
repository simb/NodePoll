This is a quick demo of showing flash and html communicating live using websockets.

The project uses node.js and socket.io as well as Flex and FlashSocket.IO

The poll presenter application is written in Flex and allows you to define a question and push that out to all participants.

The client app is written in html with jquery and allows for voting and viewing of results.

When votes are submitted the presenter application shows results.
